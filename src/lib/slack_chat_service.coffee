# Example implementation for a chat service. This exports three endpoints:
#
# - `user` takes a user name and returns an object with (at least) `name`, `id`, and `email` properties
# - `message` takes a room name/id, a "from" user, and a "to" user, and a high-five reason, and it pumps out an appropriately noisy message into the room.
# - `double` takes a room name/id, and announces a daily double
# - `boomerang` takes a room name/id and a user, and announces that that user is getting $10
